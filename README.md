This program converts a Minsky machine to Brain-Flak code

This serves as a proof that Brain-Flak is Turing complete without using the `<>` nilad

#Inputing a Minsk Machine

The three instructions are I D H

  * I is increment and takes a register and a line to jump to

  * D is decrement and takes a register along with two lines to jump to

  * H is halt.  It ends the program

Lines are 1 indexed and registers are zero indexed
